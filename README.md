# pythonPractice

This is my journey of learning (more like re-learning) Python. The end goal is to be able to be as proficient in Python as I am in JavaScript. I would love to be able to implement Python in web development so hopefully I will get there.

# Goals
- Proficiency in Python
- Algorithms in Python
- Implement Python in Web Development


# Resources
I'm currently referencing this course on Udemy by Colt Steele to help me learn Python syntax before I move on to learning about the web development technologies of Python.
